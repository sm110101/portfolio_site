# Topic selection  

## Select a broad topic area 

Start by selecting a broad topic area. 

Here are some examples:

- Bio and Health  
- Climate  
- Finance and Economics  
- Public Policy  
- Materials Discovery  
- Transportation  
- Education  
- Crime and Punishment  
- Politics and Government  
- Zoology and Botany  
- Social Phenomena  

## Narrow your focus

 - Narrow your focus to a topic that can realistically be addressed in a data driven way. 
   - e.g. `Study the effect of climate change on extreme weather` 
   - Avoid commonly used topics from Kaggle.
 - Claim your topic in the "project topic page in the shared documeent"
   - [click here to claim your topic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QL3BLRI56oFzG00RcGXGYxEiDGSTD01-0OibOk9gzAE/edit?usp=sharing)

Even if multiple students choose similar topics, each portfolio must be original. Portfolios that are too similar will be reviewed for plagiarism and may result in  Honor Council violation.

## Data Science Questions

The data science life cycle starts with well-posed questions, similar to the scientific method. A data science question is a broad idea that can be broken down into 5 to 10 smaller questions, guiding your investigation.

- "What effect is climate change having on frequency of extreme weather events? e.g hurricane, drought, forest fires, etc"
