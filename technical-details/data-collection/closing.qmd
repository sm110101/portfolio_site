## Summary

In this section, I loaded in raw data in JSON form containing a corppus of over 6 million Amazon product reviews under the 'Electronics' category. With the help of custom functions provided in the dataset's source repository, I parsed the data and passed it into a pandas dataframe.

## Challenges

- Due to the massive size of the raw data file, I had to try a bunch of new methods to successfully load it in. In the end, I elected to use a refined version of the `json` package called [`orjson`](https://github.com/ijl/orjson). Where `json` is the base python library for working with JSON formatted files, `orjson` is a third-party library build in Rust, and optimized for procedures that require rapid serialization of large-scale JSON files.
