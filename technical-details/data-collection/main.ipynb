    "In the following code, we first utilized the requests library to retrieve the HTML content from the Wikipedia page. Afterward, we employed BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and locate the specific table of interest by using the find function. Once the table was identified, we extracted the relevant data by iterating through its rows, gathering country names and their respective populations. Finally, we used Pandas to store the collected data in a DataFrame, allowing for easy analysis and visualization. The data could also be optionally saved as a CSV file for further use. \n"
