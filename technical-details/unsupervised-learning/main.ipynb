    "### Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this section is to explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of PCA and t-SNE in reducing the dimensionality of complex data while preserving essential information and improving visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**\n",
    "   - Apply PCA to your dataset.\n",
    "   - Determine the optimal number of principal components.\n",
    "   - Visualize the reduced-dimensional data.\n",
    "   - Analyze and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):**\n",
    "   - Implement t-SNE on the same dataset.\n",
    "   - Experiment with different perplexity values.\n",
    "   - Visualize the t-SNE output to reveal patterns and clusters.\n",
    "   - Compare the results of t-SNE with those from PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation and Comparison:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the effectiveness of PCA and t-SNE in preserving data structure.\n",
    "   - Compare the visualization capabilities of both techniques.\n",
    "   - Discuss the trade-offs and scenarios where one technique may perform better than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Clustering Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering) to a selected dataset. The goal is to understand how each method works, compare their performance, and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering Methods:**\n",
    "   - Apply **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical clustering** to your dataset.\n",
    "   - Write a technical summary for each method (2–4 paragraphs per method) explaining how it works, its purpose, and any model selection methods used (e.g., Elbow, Silhouette).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Results Section:**\n",
    "   - Discuss and visualize the results of each clustering analysis.\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of different clustering methods, noting any insights gained from the analysis.\n",
    "   - Visualize cluster patterns and how they relate (if at all) to existing labels in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Use professional, labeled, and clear visualizations that support your discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conclusion:**\n",
    "   - Summarize the key findings and their real-world implications in a non-technical way. Focus on the most important results and how they could apply to practical situations."
